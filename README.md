# DocClone
TFG Project (WIP)

The idea from this project is trying to take what mobile applications such as Cam Scanner and Office Lens do, one step forward. 
By using computer vision and OCR the aim is to recognize all the patterns visible in a picture of a document and trying to 
recreate the whole document from scratch. 

Some of the aspects of the proyect are yet to define, such as the libraries or type of AI needed to be able to recognize more 
complex patterns or images. What is already planned is the use of Opencv in python to do all the computer vision stuff and 
Tesseract for the OCR text recognition.
