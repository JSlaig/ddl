# DocClone

This is a Work In Progress (WIP) project aimed at taking document scanning to the next level. The goal is to leverage computer vision and OCR to recognize all visible patterns in a document image and recreate the whole document from scratch. 

There are still some aspects of the project that need to be defined, such as the specific libraries and AI models needed to recognize more complex patterns and images. However, the plan is to use OpenCV in Python for all computer vision tasks and Tesseract for OCR text recognition.

A possible dataset that can be used for training the models is available at https://disk.yandex.kz/d/3p5nGPF_HFZwgw.
